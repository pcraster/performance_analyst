Welcome to Performance Analyst's documentation!
===============================================
The goal of the Performance Analyst is to allow its users to measure the performance of snippets of Python code and store the results in a database for postprocessing. A :ref:`tool <pa.py>` is supplied which can be used to query and manage the database contents and to create plots of the performance results.

The design and terminology of this package is based on Pythonâ€™s `unit testing framework <http://docs.python.org/library/unittest.html#module-unittest>`_, so it may be useful to refer to its documentation too.
